Welcome to my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration! This repository contains my personal [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup, which I use to automate my smart home. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an awesome open-source home automation platform that focuses on privacy and local control.

## Overview

This configuration is designed for inspiration and to help others get started with their own Home Assistant setup. It includes automations for lights, sensors, switches, and more.

## Hardware

I am using the [Home Assistant Blue](https://www.home-assistant.io/blue/) with the [Home Assistant SkyConnect](https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect/) for my setup.

## Getting Started

To use this configuration, clone this repository and copy the files into your Home Assistant configuration directory. Please make sure to update the secrets in the `secrets.yaml` file with your own.
