  # From BSEC Software Library:
  #
  # The IAQ scale ranges from 0 (clean air) to 500 (heavily polluted air). During operation, algorithms
  # automatically calibrate and adapt themselves to the typical environments where the sensor is operated
  # (e.g., home, workplace, inside a car, etc.).This automatic background calibration ensures that users experience
  # consistent IAQ performance. The calibration process considers the recent measurement history (typ. up to four
  # days) to ensure that IAQ=25 corresponds to typical good air and IAQ=250 indicates typical polluted air.

# The IAQ accuracy is reflects the current state of the background calibration process, such as:
#
# IAQ Accuracy=0 could either mean:
# BSEC was just started, and the sensor is stabilizing (this lasts normally 5min in LP mode or 20min in ULP mode),
# there was a timing violation (i.e. BSEC was called too early or too late), which should be indicated by a warning/error flag by BSEC,
# IAQ Accuracy=1 means the background history of BSEC is uncertain. This typically means the gas sensor data was too stable for BSEC to clearly define its references,
# IAQ Accuracy=2 means BSEC found a new calibration data and is currently calibrating,
# IAQ Accuracy=3 means BSEC calibrated successfully.
